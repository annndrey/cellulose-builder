#summary How to extract archives of different formats (lzma, gzip, rar, zip).

= Compression Methods =

There are several different [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_algorithm compression algorithms], and several software applications for compressing and decompressing data according to those algorithms, among them `lzma`, `gzip`, `rar`, `tar` and `zip`. Usually `tar` and `gzip` are available on Linux systems without need of installation. On most Linux systems one can have `lzma`, `rar` or `zip` installed using `apt-get`, `synaptic`, `aptitude`, `yum` or equivalent package management software.


= Extracting `cellulose-builder` =

You will need different command lines depending on which archive file you choose to download.

== .tar.gz ==

{{{
tar -zxvf cellulose-builder_month_year.tar.gz
}}}

== .tar.lzma ==
Install `lzma`, then:
{{{
unlzma cellulose_builder_month_year.tar.lzma
tar -xvf cellulose_builder_month_year.tar
}}}

== .rar ==

Install `rar`, then
{{{
rar x cellulose_builder_month_year.rar
}}}

== zip ==
For this you will need `zip`'s companion program `unzip`.
{{{
unzip cellulose_builder_month_year.rar
}}}
