#summary How to extract archives of different formats (lzma, gzip, rar, zip).

= Compression Methods =

There are several different [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_algorithm compression algorithms], and several software applications for compressing and decompressing data according to those algorithms, among them `lzma`, `gzip`, `rar`, `tar` and `zip`. Typically `tar` and `gzip` are available on Linux systems without need of installation. On most Linux systems one can have `lzma`, `rar` or `zip` installed using `apt-get`, `synaptic`, `aptitude`, `yum` or equivalent package management software.


= Extracting `cellulose-builder` =

After [http://code.google.com/p/cellulose-builder/downloads/list downloading] one of the four `cellulose-builder` archive files available, navigate into the directory that contains it, for instance
{{{
cd Downloads
}}}
and extract according to the instructions you will find below.
You may wish to move the archive file to another location in your directory tree before extracting it, or you may extract first and then move the extracted directory elsewhere, it doesn't matter which you do first.
Depending on which archive file you choose to download you will need different command lines to extract it, as exemplified below.

== .tar.gz ==
{{{
tar -zxvf cellulose-builder_month_year.tar.gz
}}}

== .tar.lzma ==
Install `lzma`, then
{{{
unlzma cellulose_builder_month_year.tar.lzma
tar -xvf cellulose_builder_month_year.tar
}}}

== .rar ==
Install `rar`, then
{{{
rar x cellulose_builder_month_year.rar
}}}

== .zip ==
For this you will need `zip`'s companion program `unzip`.
{{{
unzip cellulose_builder_month_year.zip
}}}

 After extracting `cellulose-builder`'s directory from its archive file, follow
 the [http://code.google.com/p/cellulose-builder/#User_Guide User Guide] and install
 dependencies.
